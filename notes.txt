check for already running instances:
	on start, check file ~~$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/remote-control-discord-bot/instances/<name>/pid.lock~~ NOT config dir,
	need runtime dir for that

	if exists, read out the previously saved pid from it
	check if that process still exists
	if not, continue
	if yes, abort with error saying "instance still running"

	if not aborted, save own pid into the file

	java doesn't have standard way of checking processes, gotta do it scuffed by checking OS and then executing
	`ps -p <pid>` (POSIX compliant)
	if on windows, then fuck you


console for graceful shutdown:
	remote-control-discord-bot instance_name=<name> console shutdown
